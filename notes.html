    <h1>Notes on Chapter5</h1>
        <p> What does Git help us do:
            -Helps keep snapshots of project with ability to rewind and restore files of previous verisons
            -Can track changes in code and makes new software changes easily accessible
            -Allows good organization of software when collaborators change/move
            
            Some key words:
            
            Repository: A repository is a directory thatâ€™s under version control. It contains both your current working files and snapshots of the project at certain points in time
            
            Commits: Snapshots of versions at certain time points
            
            Some codes learnt:
            
            $ git config --global user.name "NAME"
            $ git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
            $ git init
            $ git clone </p>
